      "This project implements a fuzzy logic-based sensory evaluation system that aggregates scores from multiple judges to determine an overall rating. By processing linguistic inputs and applying fuzzy inference, it provides a nuanced and accurate assessment of sensory attributes such as taste, aroma, texture, and appearance. The system enhances decision-making in product quality evaluation, particularly in food and beverage industries.",

      "Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) leveraging three advanced pre-trained modelsâ€”InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and Xception. The models demonstrated strong performance, achieving accuracies of 82%, 80%, and 80%, respectively. I built a user-friendly web application using Flask to facilitate real-time mushroom species classification. Users can upload mushroom images, and the application utilizes the trained models to predict the species. To enrich the user experience, detailed descriptions of each predicted mushroom species are generated using GPT-2, providing comprehensive insights and enhancing the overall utility of the application.",
